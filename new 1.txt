KPMG is a multinational firm that provides professional services in the areas of audit, tax, and advisory. Because these services rely significantly on data, I want to apply my talents and understanding of data analysis and data modelling to help New Zealand businesses and communities prosper.As a data enthusiast, I want organisations of all sizes, from small family enterprises to large corporations, to get the most benefits from data.Everyday companies are closing down as a result of Covid-19 because they lack the necessary assistance.I wish to assist in preventing such firms from closing down by assisting them with data analytics and advising measures the businesses should take to preserve and even thrive their enterprises. As a result of these considerations, I feel KPMG is an appropriate organisation to provide me with a platform to achieve my objective of assisting businesses through the use of my data analytics abilities and expertise.
I applied to the risk consulting division since risk management is a critical procedure in every organisation. It is the process of identifying, analysing, and mitigating risks to the capital and revenue of an organisation.Data analytics is used in successful risk management because it can help the organisation to make more creative and clever decisions, as well as to take positive risk and follow development pathways. We might detect risk beforehand and prevent it from impacting project progress through using data analytics. If a company is attempting to roll out a new project, we can use data analytics to detect and minimise risk, assisting the company in avoiding excessive investment and ensuring effective project deployment. I consider risk management is an important procedure that allows me to learn about many aspects of the organisation. These are the reasons I applied for a data analytics position in KPMG's risk consulting division.
